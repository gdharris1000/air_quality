### API Key
You will need to provide your own api key, available for free here: [https://aqicn.org/data-platform/register/](https://aqicn.org/data-platform/register/)

To include the API key in the app, create an api folder in the assets directory
````bash
$ cd assets
$ cd mkdir api
````
Next, create an apikey.json file in that directory
````bash
$ cd assets/api
$ touch apikey.json
````
Add the following to the apikey.json file...
````json
{
  "apikey": "YOUR_API_KEY_GOES_HERE"
}
